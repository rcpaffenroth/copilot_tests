setup this directory for installing python packages using uv

> Copilot: The directory is now set up for installing Python packages using uv:
> 
> - A uv virtual environment has been created in .venv.
> - A .gitignore file is added to exclude virtual environment and build artifacts.
> - A requirements.txt file is ready for you to list your dependencies.
> 
> You can now add packages to requirements.txt and install them with `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`. Let me know if you want to add or install specific packages!

dong't use requirements.txt, but instead us pyproject.toml

> Copilot: 

remove requirements.txt

> Copilot: The requirements.txt file has been removed. Your project is now set up to use pyproject.toml for managing dependencies with uv. If you need help adding dependencies to pyproject.toml or installing packages, let me know!

create a github repo can push this to that newlt created repo

> Copilot: The local git repository has been initialized and your project files are committed.
> 
> To create a new GitHub repository and push your code, follow these steps:
> 
> 1. Go to https://github.com/new and create a new repository (do not initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license).
> 2. After creating the repo, copy the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git`).
> 3. Run the following commands in your terminal (replace the URL with your repo's URL):
> 
> ```bash
> git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
> git branch -M main
> git push -u origin main
> ```
> 
> Would you like me to generate these commands with your GitHub username and repo name, or do you want to handle the GitHub repo creation yourself?

use the gh command to create the github reop

> Copilot: The GitHub repository has been created and your code has been pushed to it. You can view your repo at:
> 
> https://github.com/rcpaffenroth/copilot_tests
> 
> Let me know if you need to add a README, set up actions, or make further changes!

install jax and create a notebook with a simple jax demo for solving a least squares problem

> Copilot: JAX and its dependencies are installed, and a new notebook has been created demonstrating how to solve a least squares problem using JAX. The notebook includes:
> 
> 1. Instructions for installing JAX.
> 2. Importing JAX and NumPy.
> 3. Defining the least squares problem with a random matrix and vector.
> 4. Solving the problem using JAX's linear algebra routines and displaying the results.
> 
> You can open jax_least_squares_demo.ipynb in your workspace to view or run the demo. Let me know if you want to extend or modify the notebook!
